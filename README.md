- Proficiency in interacting with external APIs for data retrieval.
- Implementation of location services and push notifications.

## Success Criteria

- The application is built using Kotlin.
- Client satisfaction with the app's performance and features.
- High user engagement with the app's event search and save/favorite functions.
- Accurate and up-to-date event information.

## Design

### Design Scope

Focused on creative UI/UX design, the app will offer local event information.
Features include event search and save event, user profiles, and detailed event information.

### Existing Asset Review

Currently, there are no baseline data models or graphic assets.

## Inspiration

The project was inspired by existing solutions such as the "Things to Do" app, which also focuses on connecting users with local events. 
While we admired its approach to event discovery, we aimed to enhance the user experience by incorporating save event, location, making it easier for users to find events that align with their interests and schedules. 
This inspiration helped shape our vision to create a more intuitive and user-centered event finding application.


### Expected Design Deliverables

- Updated Android designs stored on GitHub, featuring 2-3 screens.
- A minimal viable product (MVP) with core functionality.
- Comprehensive documentation including a project overview, asset list, licensing agreement draft, user testing results, and data modeling diagrams.
